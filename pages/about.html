<h2>In 202X, finding recipes online is a
  <em>total</em>
  nightmare:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recipe sites take ages to load</li>
  <li>The recipes themselves are buried in blog content and ads</li>
  <li>The sites have intrusive popups and cookie requests</li>
</ul>
<p>I
  <b>hate</b>
  this experience. It frustrates me to no end.
  <br>
  So, I made this place; hope you like it!
